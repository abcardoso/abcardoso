- 👋 Hi, I’m @abcardoso, a **Project / Program Manager** passionate about all those new paradigms such as cloud containers and serverless development.
- 👀 I’m interested in **Cloud Management** concepts and distributed **team building** techniques. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Google Cloud** and **AI** (nowadays studying ways to improve bearing faults predictions)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to Google Cloud, containers, Kubernetes, Docker, the challenges to managing all tasks remotely, and also **keep teams motivated**.
